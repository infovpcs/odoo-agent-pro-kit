## Resume instruction

Continue the Docker Sandbox Foundation work from the **Current state** below.
Before changing files:

1. Confirm the current Git branch and working tree.
2. Read the next task and its linked design/task sections.
3. Preserve unrelated user changes.
4. Implement only the next unblocked task.
5. Run the relevant validation and record the evidence here.
6. Do not merge, push, tag, publish, install external software, or create the
   private Pro repository without explicit user authorization.

## Project

- Repository: `infovpcs/odoo-agent-pro-kit`
- Organization: VPerfectCS
- Public license: Apache-2.0
- Supported Odoo versions: 17.0, 18.0, and 19.0
- Active workstream: public Docker Sandbox foundation and open-core commercial
  planning
- Active branch: `feature/docker-sandbox-phase-0`
- Branch base: `main` at commit `192f6c9`
- Last context update: 2026-08-12 (Asia/Kolkata)

## Objective

Build an open-source, reproducible Docker Sandbox execution layer in which each
Odoo custom-development session has an isolated agent workspace, Git branch,
Odoo runtime, PostgreSQL database, filestore, logs, MCP context, tests, and
progress state. Preserve the existing version-aware Odoo skills and
`/plan-analysis` -> `/start-coding` -> `/testing` lifecycle.

Commercial capabilities will later live in a separate private Pro repository
that consumes stable Community releases instead of forking this repository.

## Authoritative documents

### Technical

- `docs/docker-sandbox/README.md` — technical plan entry point.
- `docs/docker-sandbox/requirements.md` — scope and acceptance scenarios.
- `docs/docker-sandbox/design.md` — architecture and integration contracts.
- `docs/docker-sandbox/tasks.md` — phased implementation backlog and gates.
- `docs/docker-sandbox/source-review.md` — superseded approaches that must not
  be reintroduced.

### Commercial

- `docs/commercial/README.md` — commercial plan entry point.
- `docs/commercial/product-options.md` — packages and revenue options.
- `docs/commercial/repository-strategy.md` — Community/Pro boundaries.
- `docs/commercial/delivery-roadmap.md` — staged validation and launch plan.

## Decisions made

1. One Docker Sandbox microVM represents one agent/module development session.
2. Each sandbox uses its private Docker daemon to run an inner Compose stack
   containing the selected Odoo version and PostgreSQL.
3. Odoo does not belong in the outer agent template. The agent/tooling template
   and version-pinned Odoo service images have separate release lifecycles.
4. Writable concurrent sessions use isolated Git clones/branches by default.
5. Each session owns its database, filestore, Compose project, logs, progress,
   results, and dynamically published ports.
6. `manage_modules.sh` remains the single module install/update/test control
   point and will gain a container-aware executor.
7. Community remains useful and Apache-2.0. Team management, remote fleet,
   advanced upgrade analysis, billing, enterprise controls, and hosted service
   code belong in a separate private Pro repository.
8. Pro will consume tagged Community contracts, schemas, packages, kits, and
   images; it will not be a long-lived private fork.
9. Changes merge into `main` only through a reviewed, tested release pull
   request after the relevant exit gates pass.
10. The earlier standalone Docker Sandbox setup draft was consolidated into the
    authoritative documents and removed to prevent conflicting instructions.

## Completed

- [x] Reviewed the existing repository, local Odoo bootstrap, module manager,
  MCP configuration, hooks, fleet workflow, and agent integrations.
- [x] Validated the high-level architecture against current Docker Sandbox and
  official Odoo container documentation.
- [x] Created Docker Sandbox requirements, technical design, task pipeline, and
  superseded-research decisions.
- [x] Created commercial packages, Community/Pro repository strategy, and the
  staged recurring-revenue roadmap.
- [x] Linked technical and commercial roadmaps from the main README.
- [x] Removed the obsolete `DOCKER_SANDBOX_SETUP.md` draft after consolidation.
- [x] Created and switched to `feature/docker-sandbox-foundation`.
- [x] Ran the repository's isolated test suite: 7 tests passed.
- [x] Validated shell syntax for current shell entry points.
- [x] Validated all 18 skill files.
- [x] Ran `git diff --check` successfully.
- [x] Reviewed the Docker Sandbox and commercial planning documents for
  consistency; clarified that Community concurrency is bounded to one host and
  shared/remote team fleet orchestration belongs in Pro.
- [x] Added `scripts/validate.sh` as the project-owned validation entrypoint and
  documented it in `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- [x] Ran the validation entrypoint from a clean Bash process on 2026-08-12:
  7 tests passed, 18 skills validated, shell syntax passed, and Git whitespace
  validation passed.
- [x] Completed FOUNDATION-001 and received user approval to create the focused
  planning-foundation commit on a dedicated branch.
- [x] Added repository-wide phase workflow rules in `AGENTS.md`: one phase per
  session, mandatory checklist/LIVE TEST/documentation/context/validation, and
  one focused commit before the next phase.
- [x] Accepted ADR-0001 for the outer Sandbox/inner Compose boundary, clone-mode
  default, local-mode compatibility, and Community/Pro interface.
- [x] Selected `postgres:15-bookworm` for the initial Odoo 17/18/19 matrix and
  recorded initial resource and retention defaults.
- [x] Verified the official Odoo 17.0, 18.0, and 19.0 registry indexes contain
  Linux amd64 and arm64/v8 manifests on 2026-08-12.
- [x] Defined the public Community and separately licensed Enterprise addon
  boundary.
- [x] Added version 1.0.0 session and operation-result JSON schemas plus schema
  contract tests; the repository suite now has 9 passing tests.
- [x] Installed official `docker-sbx` 0.38.0 and Git on the authorized Oracle
  Cloud Ubuntu 24.04 validation VPS; added `ubuntu` to the `kvm` group and
  initialized Docker's balanced local Sandbox policy.
- [x] Authenticated `sbx` through Docker's device OAuth flow without recording
  credentials in the repository; all 9 diagnostic checks passed.
- [x] Captured template, kit, secret, policy, ports, shared-skills, SSH, clone,
  CPU, memory, and publish command capabilities. Kits, skills, SSH, and custom
  secrets identify themselves as experimental in 0.38.0.
- [x] Passed the Ubuntu Phase 0 LIVE TEST: stock clone-mode Codex sandbox,
  private Docker 29.7.1, Compose 5.4.0, nginx HTTP, ephemeral loopback port,
  stop/start persistence, evidence copy, sandbox removal, and port cleanup.
- [x] User approved the platform validation policy: use the available Intel Mac
  for repository/Docker/registry checks and the Ubuntu 24.04 KVM VPS for all
  Docker Sandbox microVM and runtime LIVE TESTS.
- [x] Completed the Phase 0 checklist and platform-adjusted exit gate.

## Current state

- FOUNDATION-001 is committed as `2c2b6d6` on
  `feature/docker-sandbox-planning-foundation`.
- Phase 0 is complete and committed on `feature/docker-sandbox-phase-0` with
  subject `Complete Docker Sandbox Phase 0 validation`.
- Docker CLI and daemon are available.
- Docker version observed: `29.7.2`.
- Docker daemon reported Linux `x86_64` containers on this host.
- Docker Sandbox CLI (`sbx`) is not installed. The official Homebrew cask was
  trusted but installation rejected this Intel Mac because it requires arm64.
- The accessible VPS is Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64 with Docker 27.3.1, 256 GiB free,
  and no `/dev/kvm`; it was inspected read-only and is unsupported for `sbx`.
- The Oracle validation VPS is Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 with 2 vCPU, 15 GiB RAM,
  nested KVM, and 45 GiB root disk. After Sandbox cleanup it used 5.9 GiB.
- The Oracle VPS retains `docker-sbx` 0.38.0, its cached Codex template, Docker
  OAuth login, balanced policy, disposable Git repository, and exported
  `/home/ubuntu/phase0-evidence.txt`; no sandbox or published port remains.
- The global Conda pytest environment auto-loads an incompatible
  `pytest-asyncio` plugin and fails during collection.
- Repository tests pass when external plugin auto-loading is disabled:
  `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python3 -m pytest -q tests`.
- The working tree is clean. No branch has been pushed and no private Pro
  repository has been created.

## Blockers and risks

### Immediate

- Phase 0 cannot validate Docker Sandbox capabilities until `sbx` is installed
  and authenticated.
- Docker supports Sandbox on Apple Silicon macOS 14+; this host is Intel macOS.
- Docker supports Linux Sandbox on Ubuntu 24.04+ with KVM; the accessible VPS is
  Ubuntu 20.04 and nested virtualization is unavailable (`/dev/kvm` missing).
- Native macOS Sandbox behavior remains untested because the workstation is
  Intel. It is not required by the approved validation policy unless a future
  task claims native macOS Sandbox support.

### Tracked design risks

- Docker Sandbox kits and SSH are evolving and require CLI capability/version
  checks.
- Odoo image and API behavior must be verified independently for 17/18/19.
- Nested Docker has meaningful disk and memory cost; limits must be measured.
- Clone-mode changes can be lost during destruction without commit/patch export.
- Odoo Enterprise sources and customer data require strict private boundaries.

## Next task

### Task ID: ODOO19-001 — Phase 1 Odoo 19 runtime proof of concept

Goal: implement and validate the public Odoo 19 inner Compose runtime through
the stable controller contract on the Ubuntu Sandbox validation host.

Steps:

- [ ] Add healthy PostgreSQL and Odoo 19 Compose services with pinned inputs.
- [ ] Add generated container-safe configuration and distinct credentials.
- [ ] Add a fixture addon and session-private DB, filestore, cache, logs, and
  results paths.
- [ ] Add bounded readiness checks and failure diagnostics.
- [ ] Implement basic `sandboxctl` lifecycle commands and structured session,
  event, and operation-result output.
- [ ] LIVE TEST: install, update, RPC-test, restart, export, and destroy an Odoo
  19 fixture module twice cold and twice warm with no orphaned volumes.

Work from a fresh session after reading this file and the Phase 1 section of
`docs/docker-sandbox/tasks.md`.

## Following tasks

1. **ODOO18/17-001:** generalize the runtime and complete the Odoo 17/18 matrix.
2. **KIT-001:** integrate the existing module manager and lifecycle skills.
3. Continue in the order and gates defined by
   `docs/docker-sandbox/tasks.md`.

## Validation commands

Run the repository-owned validation entrypoint:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

Clean-shell LIVE TEST command:

```bash
env -i PATH="$PATH" /bin/bash --noprofile --norc ./scripts/validate.sh
```

Results on 2026-08-12 after Phase 0 completion:

- Repository tests: `9 passed in 0.44s`.
- Skills: `18 skill file(s) validated, no issues found`.
- Shell syntax: passed.
- Git whitespace validation: passed.

## Release workflow

```text
feature branch
  -> implementation and documentation
  -> focused validation
  -> phase exit gate
  -> release notes and version update
  -> pull request and review
  -> explicit approval
  -> merge to main
  -> signed tag and release
```

Never treat a task checkbox as permission to push, merge, tag, publish, create
external resources, or perform a paid operation.

## Context update protocol

At the end of every working session:

1. Update **Last context update**.
2. Move finished items into **Completed** with test evidence.
3. Rewrite **Current state** from actual `git status`, tools, and runtime state.
4. Record blockers with the exact failing command or missing authority.
5. Set exactly one **Next task** with acceptance and LIVE TEST requirements.
6. Keep only the next few dependent items under **Following tasks**.
7. Record commits, pull requests, tags, releases, and external resources only
   after they actually exist.
